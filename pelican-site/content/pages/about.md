I grew up in Vancouver, got a B.A.Sc. from the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a> and since then I've continued to move approximately every two years for travel, life and work. I'm now based in San Francisco, but I continue to spend time with family in Vancouver and Monterrey, Mexico.

Outside of the hobbies shown on this site I also enjoy hiking, swimming, juggling, and playing board games.
