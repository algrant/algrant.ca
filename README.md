## Source Code for algrant.ca

Previously I used the python static site generator [wok](https://github.com/mythmon/wok), but as that hasn't been updated in a few years I needed to find a new one.

I chose [pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) given it's got a big community, many plugins/themes, continues to be maintained and is also written in python.

This is really a repo just for myself, but feel free to look around! If I recall correctly I cribbed all the scripts from the theme I chose [medius](https://github.com/onur/medius).

## Reminders...
1) Activate mini-conda environment
  ```conda activate algrant-pelican```
2) Run in dev mode using livereload
  ```invoke livereload```
3) If pages aren't compiling try debug mode for extra information.
  ```pelican -D```
