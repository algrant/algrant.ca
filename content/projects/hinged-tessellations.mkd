#What are they?
A _tessellation_ is a set of figures which can cover the plane indefinitely. A _hinged tessellation_ is a set of figures which not only cover the plane indefinitely, but has a set of hinges such that each figure can rotate about it's neighbours.

#Regular Hinged Tessellations
The idea of linking a bunch of squares by their vertices has been stumbled across and explored by a number of people, and led to the discovery of a couple other hinged tessellation variations: including two different sized squares, hexagons with triangles, and octagons with squares.

#Irregular Hinged Tessellations?
Squares and hexagons are boring. *Of course* they'd work nicely together to hinge.  When I first 'discovered' hinged tessellations I was most interested in which irregular shapes might work (if any).  I was using blocks at the time and with a little experimentation I constructed this:

![trapezoid.gif](/images/hinged-tessellations/trapezoid.gif)

Thus it was clear to me that not only regular polygons could work; as that shape is actually a trapezoid (if we only focus on the hinged vertices).

**Cool**. I of course then sketched out some other trapezoids, and decided that potentially the reason why they can hinge so nicely is because their pairs of corners are both _supplementary_ (add up to 180째).  This seemed especially important due to the fact that when the hinges are 'open', all the holes seemed to be rectangular; thus any two adjoined corners + two right angles must equal 360째.

Given that a quadrilateral has 4 corners, there are two different way we can set up the supplementary angles, either next to each other (a trapezoid) _or_ opposite each other. I learned later that these are called [cyclic quadrilaterals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral), because all the vertices lie on a circle.

I knew that one can actually tile the cyclic quadrilateral (because it's been proven that one can tile [all quadrilaterals](http://euler.slu.edu/escher/index.php/Tessellations_by_Polygons#Tessellations_by_Quadrilaterals)), but looking at that tessellation (see below) it is pretty clearly not hingeable.

I first tried a few times tessellating just the cyclic quads in a similar fashion to the trapezoids, but it was apparent that they wouldn't line up correctly.  On a whim I mirrored a couple of the pieces, and then I was pretty certain I had a hingeable structure!

The next step was trying to come up with a geometric proof, but I had no real idea how to go about it (I'm an engineer! I like finding the answers, but coming up with a real proof seemed pretty tough). I had a meeting with a computer graphics professor one day and brought up this little problem, and his suggestion was just to code up a solution - which seemed like a good plan, as best case scenario I stumble across a proof, worst case, I have a little program to draw hinged tessellations!

Anyway, without further ado:
